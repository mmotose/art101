			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding. Learning how to break down problems into pseudocode.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The prompt is not very clear, so my partner and I had to spend a bit of time deciphering what we were supposed to do. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The pseudocoding part itself was very simple, however, the assignment was not worded well and caused a lot of confusion.
						Overall, this assignment was a cakewalk after figuring out where to place the text and pseudocode comments. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<pre><code>
						//Make Bacon, Hash Browns, and Eggs.
						//Making Hash Browns
							//Pour neutral oil into a frying pan and heat pan to medium-high heat.
							//Throw frozen Hash Browns into the pan.
							//Season with Garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
							//Wait until one side is turning a golden color, then flip.
							//Continue until desired crispyness is achieved.
							//Put it on a plate.
						//Making Bacon
							//Heat up a clean, non-oiled frying pan to medium heat.
							//Take pre cut bacon, blot moisture off with a paper towel.
							//Throw in the pan once hot, season with garlic powder.
							//Once cooked to your liking, put on a plate.
						//Making Eggs
							//Take the frying pan with the bacon grease, and add more oil if needed.
							//Heat to medium heat.
							//Crack eggs into the pan.
							//Wait until the whites start to become opaque, then flip.
							//Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
							//Once finished, put on a plate.
							//Optional
							//Add cheese if you are not lactose intolerant.
							//If you do not like bacon, use sausage.
							//If Keto, replace hash browns with carrots

						//Card Game War
						//Generate standard deck of cards (52 cards, 4 suits)
							//“Shuffle”/Randomize the cards 
							//Cut deck in half
							//Give half the deck to Player A and the other half to Player B
						//Player A select 1 card from their half of the deck
						//Player B select 1 card from their half of the deck
							//Compare the two cards
								//If Player A has the higher number or face card than Player B then they win the match they get one point
								//If Player B has the higher number or face card than Player A then they win the match they get one point
						//Discord the drawn cards
						//Repeat until cards runout 
						//Compare point scores, whoever has the most wins
